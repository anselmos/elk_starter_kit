# ELK Elasticsearch Logstash and Kibana Starter Kit

This is just a Starter Kit for ELK stack.

It's meant only for development, not for production.

# How to use this repo?

You can download only the `Makefile` and then proceeed with :
```bash
make run
```

This will start 3 containers ( firstly pulling them from docker.elastic.com elastic-docker-hub):
- elastic
- logstash
- kibana
